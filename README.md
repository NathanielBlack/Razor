#Razor (cshtml) Syntax Definition for Sublime Text

##NOTE
Please contact me if you are interested in taking over this project. I never use the Razor syntax anymore so the project has gone stagnant.

##Overview
Having been unable to find a Razor Syntax Definition for Razor anywhere, I decided to do this myself.

##Installation
Use [Sublime Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net). It's the best.

##Extend/Improve
Checkout out the [issues](//github.com/joseph-turner/Razor/issues) page to submit bugs and feature requests.
