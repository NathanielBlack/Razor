Razor Syntax Highlighting
===============================================================================

+ Fixed problem with C# keywords, like "class", breaking formatting in Razor sections

+ Added snippets to use instead of completions. (Sublime Text gives these higher priority and the completions are being ignored in favor of plugin snippets like Emmet.)
